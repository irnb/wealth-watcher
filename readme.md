# Wealth Watcher

WealthWatcher is an open-source project designed to monitor the Ethereum network (EVM based chain), specifically focusing on Decentralized Exchange (DEX) protocols. Utilizing Rust for its performance and safety features, WealthWatcher aims to identify and score Ethereum addresses based on the profitability of the assets they acquire from these exchanges.

The goal of WealthWatcher is to provide DeFi traders, investors, and analysts with a tool that can detect which addresses have bought the most profitable assets over a given period. By scoring these addresses based on their asset acquisition performance, WealthWatcher provides a list of the most profitable addresses in the Ethereum network. This information can be used to identify potential trading opportunities, track the performance of specific addresses, and analyze the behavior of DeFi traders.

## Roadmap

The WealthWatcher project is currently in the early stages of development. The roadmap for the project includes the following milestones:

1. **Data Collection**: Implement a data collection system that can monitor the Ethereum network and extract relevant information about DEX transactions.
   - Status: 🚧 In Progress
2. **Data Analysis**: Develop algorithms to analyze the collected data and identify profitable addresses based on their asset acquisition performance.
   - Status: 📝 Not Started
3. **Scoring System**: Implement a scoring system that assigns a score to each address based on its profitability.
   - Status: 📝 Not Started
4. **API Integration**: Create an API that allows users to access the WealthWatcher data and scoring system.
   - Status: 📝 Not Started
